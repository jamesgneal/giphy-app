# Giphy App
### Homework assignment 6 - create a giphy app using the GIPHY API, AJAX and jQuery to manipulate the HTML
#### Summary
Simple web app to utilize the GIPHY API. Minimal HTML supplies the layout structure and search feature, but the topic buttons are dynamically generated from a JavaScript array. Searching for new topics adds a new string to the array, and builds a new button. Clicking the buttons calls on the GIPHY API with that topic as subject matter, then calls a function to display the results with some data. Clicking an image starts the animation, clicking again will stop it.
